  "what_we_do": {
    "culture": "<p>What does it mean to be an American National insurance agent?</p><p>It means building a successful independent business while helping your neighbors protect what they value the most. It means finding that balance between your career, your lifestyle, your goals and your beliefs. It means being truly rewarded for your hard work and effort.</p><p>It means more.</p>",
    "rewards": "<p>Our agents are the face of American National and are essential to the company’s success. That’s why American National feels it’s important to significantly reward and recognize top achievers. They offer numerous production, profit bonus opportunities and performance-based awards. One sought-after incentive is an invitation for the agent and a guest to the annual marketing conference, held in noteworthy locales across the globe. Past conference locations include Rome, Key Biscayne, Paris, Madrid, London, Monte Carlo, Sydney and Hong Kong.</p>",
    "intro": "<p>American National prides itself on being a family-oriented company. Working with dedicated people who embrace this tradition lays a foundation for rewarding careers, and provides our customers with the service they expect and deserve. This concept has helped American National become one of the leading life insurance providers in the industry.</p>",
    "training_development": "<p>While a background in sales is certainly beneficial when building a career as an insurance agent, it’s not a necessity. The majority of our agents didn’t get their start in insurance. If you are a self-starter, highly motivated, enjoy building relationships and have a passion to exceed expectations – you already have the tools for success.</p><p>American National takes an innovative approach to training with paid internships. Candidates selected for the Agent Career Program (ACP) become agency interns and receive paid training through Kelly OCG, a third-party company contracted with American National. It’s important for candidates to focus on learning the skills and receiving the in-depth training they will need to be successful, rather than wondering how they will support themselves while in the program.</p><p>To help candidates better understand the day-to-day tasks involved in running an insurance agency, each agency intern spends several weeks working in the office of a “mentor agent” gaining the skills needed to be successful. This on-the-job learning prepares agents to handle client needs from the first day they establish their agency.</p>"
